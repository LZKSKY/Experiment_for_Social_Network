## Attention!

Here is a paper list of various works in social media. Some with code implementation, some without. 

You need to **choose one and implement** their model or only baseline for complex task, and write a summarization with **at least 4 pages and 2 column**(双栏四页).

For template,  we recommend template in 中文信息学报 and welcome others。Word or latex or others.

For paper to implement, you are encouraged to choose other work about social media searched by yourself.

For deadline, ...
